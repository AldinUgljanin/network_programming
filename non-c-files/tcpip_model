1. Network Access
    - On this later, physical connections and data farming happen.
    Sending an Ethernet or Wi-Fi packet are examples of layer 1 concerns.
2. Internet
    - This layer deals with the concerns of addressing packets and routing them
    overmultiple interconnection networks.It's at this layer that an IP address
    is defined.
3. Host-to-Host
    - The host-to-host layer provides two protoclos, TCP and UDP, which we will
    discuss in the next few chapters. These protocols address concerns such as
    data order, data segmentation, network congestion and error correction.
4. Process/Application
    - The process/application later is where protocols such as HTTP, SMTP and
    FTP are implemented.
