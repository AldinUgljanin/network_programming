1. Physical
    - At this level we have specifications for things such as the voltage 
    levels on an Ethernet cable, what each pin on a connector is for,
    the radio frequency of Wi-Fi and the light flashes over an optic fiber.
2. Data Link
    - This level deals with protocols for directly communicating between 
    two nodes. It defines how a direct message between nodes starts and ends
    (framing), error detection and correction and flow control.
3. Network
    - The network layer provides the methodsto transmit data sequanves
    (called packets) between nodes i different networks. It provides methods
    to route packets from one node to another(without a direct physical 
    connection) by transferring through many intermediate nodes.
    This is the layer that the Internet Protocol is defined on.
4. Transport
    - At this layer, we have methods to reliably deliver variable length data 
    between hosts. These methods deal with splitting up data, recomining it,
    ensuring data arrives in order and so on.
    The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Prtocol (UDP)
    are commonly said to exist on this layer.
5. Session
    - This layer builds on the transport layer by adding method to establish,
    checkpoint, suspend resume and terminate dialogs.
6. Presentation
    - This is the lowest layer at which data structure and presentaion for an
    application are defined. Concerns such as data encoding, serialization, and
    encryption are handled here.
7. Application
    - The  applications that the user interfaces with 
    (for example, web browsers and email clients) exist here. These applications
    make use of the services provided by the six lower layers.
