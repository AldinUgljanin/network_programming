1. socket()
    -- creates and initializes a new socket
2. bind()
    -- associates a socket with a particular local IP address and port number
3. listen()
    -- is used on the server to cause a TCP socket to listen for new connections
4. connect()
    -- is used on the client to set the remote address and port. 
    In the case of TCP, it also establishes a connection
5. accept()
    -- is used on the server to create a new socket for an incoming TCP 
    connection.
6. send() and recv()
    -- are used to send and receive data with a socket
7. sendto() and recvfrom() 
    -- are used to send and receive data from sockets without a bound remote
    address.
8. close() (Berkeley sockets) and closesocket() (Winsock sockets) 
    -- are used to close a socket. In the case of TCP, this also terminates
    the connection.
9. shutdown()
    -- is used to close one side of a TCP connection. It is useful to ensure
    an orderly connection teardown.
10. select()
    -- is used to wait for an event on one or more sockets.
11. getnameinfo() and getaddrinfo()
    -- provide a protocol-independent manner of working with hostnames and 
    addresses
12. setsockopt()
    -- is used to change some socket options
13. dcntl() (Berkeley sockets) and ioctlsocket() (Winsock sockets)
    -- are also used to get and set some socket options
